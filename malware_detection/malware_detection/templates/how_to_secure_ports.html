    <h1>Open Ports Information</h1>

    <h2>Ports Information</h2>
    <p>
      An open port is a network port that accepts traffic either using TCP or UDP
      and allows communication with underlying server technologies. Open ports are
      required when hosting remote services to which end-users can connect. There
      are 65535 total ports of TCP and UDP.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Common ports open:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        TCP port 21 FTP (File Transfer Protocol) – Provides a way to transfer
        files between computers that operate on the simple get and put concepts to
        either receive or send files to a remote endpoint. FTP was not intended to
        be a secure means of communication
      </li>
      <li>
        TCP port 22 SSH (Secure Shell) – The purpose of SSH is to provide
        administrators the ability to connect to an endpoint over an unsecured
        network securely
      </li>
      <li>
        TCP port 23 Telnet – allows interacting with a network endpoint from the
        command line and is sometimes used as a tool for remote management
      </li>
      <li>
        TCP port 25 SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) – a protocol used to
        relay mail from email server to email server
      </li>
      <li>
        TCP and UDP port 53 DNS (Domain Name System) – a protocol used for name
        resolution across the Internet. It traverses port 53 using TCP and UDP
        connections. DNS is responsible for converting the IP addresses that are
        non-intuitive to the human-friendly domain names typed into a web browser
      </li>
      <li>
        TCP port 110 POP3 – Known as the Post Office Protocol, it is used by email
        clients to synchronize and download mail from remote mail servers
      </li>
      <li>
        TCP port 145 IMAP – Internet Message Access Protocol synchronizes and
        displays emails without the need to download them
      </li>
      <li>
        TCP ports 80 & 443 HTTP and HTTPS – HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol)
        and HTTPS (Hypertext Transport Protocol over SSL) are today’s web servers’
        standard protocols and ports. HTTP port 80 is the legacy, insecure
        protocol and port in use, while HTTPS is the secured web server protocol
        and port used for encrypted web communications. Most organizations have
        deprecated the use of HTTP across the board as it is clear text and
        insecure communication
      </li>
      <li>TCP port 81 – Commonly used as a web proxy port</li>
      <li>
        TCP and UDP port 135, 137, 139 — Windows Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and
        Windows NetBIOS over TCP/IP are well-known in Windows networking. These
        communicate over TCP and UDP ports 135, 137, and 139 and historically have
        many vulnerabilities
      </li>
      <li>
        TCP port 1433 SQL – Microsoft SQL Server, used throughout many enterprise
        organizations today communicates over TCP port 1433.
      </li>
      <li>
        TCP port 3306 MySQL – This port is used for MySQL database communication
      </li>
      <li>
        TCP port 3389 RDP – Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is used to display
        remote GUI desktop sessions of a remote Windows computer. It is commonly
        used with Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environments.
      </li>
      <li>
        TCP port 5900 VNC – VNC is a tool that is commonly used for remote access
        administration. It communicates on TCP port 5900.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How To Protect A Port</h2>
    <p>
      When it comes to protecting open ports, the first step is only to use ports
      that encrypt traffic. It means that an attacker cannot easily capture
      network traffic and decipher sensitive information. Organizations also want
      to scrutinize and decide if an open port is necessary. As mentioned at the
      outset, any open port increases the attack surface and the potential for
      compromise due to vulnerabilities, misconfiguration, and other factors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open ports to the Internet should sit behind a modern firewall or another
      filtering device to scrutinize traffic connecting to the open port. It
      ensures the communication is meant to be valid communication with the
      technology listening on that port or if it has malicious intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open ports should also be segmented from your internal network in what is
      known as a DMZ or demilitarized zone. If an attacker compromises the open
      network port, it is easier to contain the malicious activity if segmented
      from the rest of the network.
    </p>
    <p>
      Password-protected services that are listening on an open port require
      organizations to protect the passwords used to authenticate services on
      these ports. Aside from never using cleartext protocols, this point
      emphasizes the need to have strong password policies that prevent weak,
      breached, or easily guessable passwords.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last, but perhaps the most important, make sure the underlying technologies
      and systems listening and answering on the open port are fully patched, and
      security updates are applied as soon as possible. Attackers often look for
      unpatched vulnerabilities to compromise an open port. In addition to the
      strategies mentioned above for protecting open ports, auditing, and other
      cybersecurity strategies, businesses must enforce strong passwords and use
      strong password policies.
    </p>

    <h2>SMTP (mail) Port Open</h2>
    <p>
      <b> Step 1: Gather IP addresses used to send email </b>

      <br />The first step to implement SPF is to identify which mail servers you
      use to send email from your domain. Many organizations send mail from a
      variety of places. Make a list of all your mail servers and their IP
      addresses, and be sure to consider whether any of the following are used to
      send email on behalf of your brand:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Web server</li>
      <li>Your email service provider’s (ESP) mail server</li>
      <li>In-office mail server (e.g., Microsoft Exchange)</li>
      <li>The mail server of your end users’ mailbox provider</li>
      <li>
        Any other third-party mail server used to send email on behalf of your
        brand
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you’re unsure of what your IP addresses are, reach out to your ESP to get
      a list of the addresses associated with your account or your IT System
      Administrator to compile a list of IP addresses your business uses.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Step 2: Make a list of your sending domains </b>

      <br />Chances are, your company owns many domains. Some of these domains are
      used to send email. Others aren’t. It’s important to create SPF records for
      all the domains you control, even the ones you’re not mailing from. Why?
      Once you’ve protected your sending domains with SPF, the first thing a
      criminal will do is try to spoof your non-sending domains.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b> Step 3: Create a SPF record </b>

      <br />SPF authenticates a sender’s identity by comparing the sending mail
      server’s IP address to the list of authorized sending IP addresses the
      sender publishes in the DNS record. Here’s how to create your SPF record:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Start with v=spf1 (version 1) tag and follow it with the IP addresses that
        are authorized to send mail. For example, v=spf1 ip4:1.2.3.4 ip4:2.3.4.5
      </li>
      <li>
        If you use a third party to send email on behalf of the domain in
        question, you must add an “include” statement in your SPF record (e.g.,
        include:thirdparty.com) to designate that third party as a legitimate
        sender
      </li>
      <li>
        Once you have added all authorized IP addresses and include statements,
        end your record with an ~all or -all tag
      </li>
      <li>
        An ~all tag indicates a soft SPF fail while an -all tag indicates a hard
        SPF fail. In the eyes of the major mailbox providers ~all and -all will
        both result in SPF failure. Validity recommends an -all as it is the most
        secure record.
      </li>
      <li>
        SPF records cannot be over 255 characters in length and cannot include
        more than ten include statements, also known as “lookups.” Here’s an
        example of what your record might look like: v=spf1 ip4:1.2.3.4
        ip4:2.3.4.5 include:thirdparty.com -all
      </li>
      <li>
        For your domains that do not send email, the SPF record will exclude any
        modifier with the exception of -all. Here’s an example record for a
        non-sending domain: v=spf1 –all
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Congratulations! You’ve created your SPF record. Now, it’s time to publish
      it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Step 4: Publish your SPF to DNS </b>

      <br />Work with your DNS server administrator to publish your SPF record to
      DNS so mailbox providers can reference it. If you’re using a hosting
      provider such as 123-reg or GoDaddy, then this process is fairly simple. If
      your ISP administers your DNS records or if you aren’t sure, contact your IT
      department for support. Email service providers typically publish SPF
      records for sending domains on your behalf.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Step 5: Testing SPF records! </b>

      <br />Test your SPF record with an SPF check tool. You’ll be able to see
      what recipients see: A list of the servers authorized to send email on
      behalf of your sending domain. If one or more of your legitimate sending IP
      addresses is not listed, you can update your record to include it.
    </p>

    <h2>HTTP Open Port</h2>
    <p>
      You can go ahead and just type ‘HTTPS’ into the address bar on any old site.
      If the site has a valid certificate, then the server hosting the site will
      present that certificate to your browser (which has a built-in list of
      trusted certificate issuers) and nothing really noticeable happens...
    </p>

    <h2>FTP Open Port</h2>
    <p>
      If FTP port open we send to STP to secure file sharing<br />Moreover, there
      are many ports open but we aware that any application port is not open.
